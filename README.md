# Fox of Hood

This is a Web App developed using ReactJS and NodeJS for DB integration.

## Steps to run the program on local development environment

For this app, you will need NodeJS installed in your local. Open a terminal and navigate to the repository folder.

To install all the dependencies on your terminal type:
### 'npm install'

Since we are using our local machine as the Database, you require postgreSQL installed on your machine. You will find the executable file on their official website.
Make sure to include pgadmin during installation to manage the database.

## Database schema and documentation will be provided shortly

Once we are done setting up the Database, enter the DB credentials in the src\backend\server.js

Now you are all set to start the development server. Now in one of the terminal enter the following command.
### `npm start`


Open another terminal window, navigate to src\backend folder and enter the following code to start the backend server.
### 'node server.js'

Now the app and the backend server is all set.
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
